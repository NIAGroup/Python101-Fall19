# Python 101 Series: Week 4

**Tasks:** 

Today will be a class exercises day! Let's tackle these problems together.
   
   
**Challenges:**

1.) Write a Python program to convert month name to a number of days.

Example:

     - Input the name of Month: February                                       
     - No. of days: 28/29 days 

2.) Write a program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a transaction log from console input. 

The transaction log format is shown as following:

    D 100
    W 200

D means deposit while W means withdrawal.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

    D 300
    D 300
    W 200
    D 100
    
Then, the output should be:
500

Hints: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

3.) Write a Python program to read a text file line by line store it into an array. Print the array.

Happy coding!
